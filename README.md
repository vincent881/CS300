What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    I learned how to code more efficient programs. The projects in this course helped me understand how to plan and choose the most efficient algorithms for different problems. Specifically, I needed to create a program thate creates a list of courses, sorts those courses, and displays any prerequisites for a chosen course.
    
How did you approach this problem?
    I approached this problem by creating psuedocode and planning my program before I began. The program needed to be able to create a list of courses, sort those courses, and display any prerequisites for a chosen course. I used a Binary Search algorithm to sort the list. 
    
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    When encountering roadblocks in my code, I would take a break from coding and focus on something else. This helped me rething the problem a different way and it worked!
    
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    Before knowing how to use data structures and algorithms, coding felt very straight forward and caged. I now feel I can do much more with programming.
    
How was your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
    My programs are very different now. The different algorithms I created are adaptable to other programs I can create. I think my programs are the same when talking about maintanability and readability.
